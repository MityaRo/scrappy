# Scrappy - App Store Reviews Collector

_(vibecoded all the way:) )_

Scrappy is a web application that allows you to collect and analyze App Store reviews for iOS applications. Built with Next.js, it provides a simple interface to fetch reviews from the Apple App Store and download them as JSON files.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Enter App Information:**

   - **App Name**: The name of the iOS app (e.g., "WalkFit")
   - **App ID**: The unique identifier from the App Store URL (e.g., "1457956232")

2. **Get Reviews Automatically:**

   - As soon as both fields are filled, reviews are fetched automatically
   - Results appear in real-time

3. **Download Data:**
   - Click "Download JSON" to save the review data
   - Files are named: `reviews-{appName}-{appId}.json`

## üìñ How to Use

### Finding App IDs

To find an app's ID:

1. Go to the App Store
2. Search for the app
3. Copy the ID from the URL: `https://apps.apple.com/app/id{APP_ID}`

**Example:** For WalkFit, the URL is `https://apps.apple.com/app/id1457956232`, so the App ID is `1457956232`
